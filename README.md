## Interactive Q&A Walkthrough

### Task 1: Protocol Identification
**Q**: What does the 3-letter acronym FTP stand for?

> _Answer:_ **File Transfer Protocol**

---

### Task 2: Default FTP Port
**Q**: Which port does the FTP service listen on usually?

> _Answer:_ **21**

---

### Task 3: Secure Alternative Protocol
**Q**: FTP sends data in the clear. What acronym is used for the secure extension of FTP over SSH?

> _Answer:_ **SFTP**

---

### Task 4: Connectivity Testing Command
**Q**: What is the command used to send an ICMP echo request?

> _Answer:_ **ping**

---

### Task 5: Service Identification
**Q**: From your scans, what version is FTP running on the target?

> _Answer:_ **vsftpd 3.0.3**

---

### Task 6: OS Fingerprinting
**Q**: From your scans, what OS type is running on the target?

> _Answer:_ **Unix**

---

### Task 7: FTP Help Menu
**Q**: What is the command to display the 'ftp' client help menu?

> _Answer:_ **ftp -?**

---

### Task 8: Anonymous Username
**Q**: Username used over FTP for unauthenticated login?

> _Answer:_ **anonymous**

---

### Task 9: FTP Login Success Code
**Q**: What is the response code for 'Login successful'?

> _Answer:_ **230**

---

### Task 10: Directory Listing
**Q**: Common FTP command to list files and directories other than 'dir'?

> _Answer:_ **ls**

---

### Task 11: File Downloading Command
**Q**: Command used to download files over FTP?

> _Answer:_ **get**

---

### Task 12: Root Flag Extraction
**Q**: What is the root flag?

> _Flag:_ **035db21c881520061c53e0536e44f815**

## Technical Assessment Summary

### Key Vulnerabilities

- **Anonymous FTP Authentication (CWE-287, CVSS 9.1 CRITICAL):** No credentials required, full filesystem access.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure (CWE-200/CWE-732):** World-readable files (644 permissions).
- **Cleartext Data Transmission (CWE-319, CVSS 5.9 MEDIUM):** FTP data sent with no encryption.
- **Lack of Network Access Controls (CWE-284):** Service open to all IPs, no firewall filtering.

### Attack Chain Overview

1. **Reconnaissance** — Nmap service scan identifies FTP on port 21.
2. **Initial Access** — Login via FTP using 'anonymous', exploit authentication bypass.
3. **Discovery** — Use 'ls' and 'dir' to view directories/files.
4. **Exfiltration** — Download flag using 'get flag.txt'.

_Compromise achieved in under 15 minutes._

### Remediation Recommendations

- **Disable Anonymous FTP**: Edit `/etc/vsftpd.conf` and set `anonymous_enable=NO`.
- **Migrate to SFTP/FTPS** for encrypted file transfer.
- **Enforce Least Privilege** on sensitive files (`chmod 600`, `chown root:root`).
- **Implement Network Controls**: Restrict access to trusted IP addresses using firewall rules.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Enable logging, SIEM integration, and regular vulnerability scans.

### Compliance Impact

- Breaches **PCI-DSS 8.1**, **HIPAA 164.312(a)(2)(i)**, **GDPR Article 32** standards.
